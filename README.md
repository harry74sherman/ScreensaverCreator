# ScreensaverCreator

My casual creator gives users an opportunity to create a custom, fun, and beautiful desktop screensaver or virtual postcard for a friend or loved one. The final product is based on a number of random factors combined with user-generated text input. Random elements, including random fonts, text size, and background color keep the creative experience unique and exciting, and the rolling, rainlike animation of the letters creates an experience that is hard to look away from. Once a user’s message is generated and they have manipulated the orientation of the letters on the screen, I imagine the user will be proud and excited to share their work due to it’s aesthetic and ease of creation. To share the final product they create, a user can take a screenshot at any time, and send it to their friends, post it on social media, and so on. 

This project is personally meaningful to me because it allowed me to keep building on one of the topics that I enjoyed most from my experience in CC this semester: working with text. I never knew that I took such joy from working with letters and words, but this has been one of my favorite classes at Bowdoin due in part to our two text-generation assignments. While my project is not built on top of a generative algorithm or n-gram foundation, I view that functionality as an exciting possible future extension of my Casual Creator!

This Casual Creator challenged me in a number of ways. In some ways, it felt like I was creating a product for a company, which I have never done before. However, I know that when making a product for a company, one needs to be mindful of the user experience for a diverse group of users, because what I find fun and engaging might not be fun to someone else. As such, each of my five roommates and my mom took a turn using my casual creator. After they used my system, I asked for their thoughts and feedback, and then I made tweaks based on both what they said and my observations of them while using the system (mistakes they made, problems they encountered, bugs they uncovered, etc). Considering others’ creative preferences was a new and challenging experience for me, but I believe it all made for a better product. 

This project also challenged me from a technical standpoint as well. Even though I had used Processing once before (for the first project we did for this class), I took on the challenge of creating some significantly more ambitious functionality than I did in my first project, including gathering, clicking and dragging, and dynamic falling, and opted to use data structures that I haven’t worked with since taking data structures 3 years ago, such as LinkedLists and ArrayLists. I also became introduced to a number of new Processing libraries and functionality which, while challenging, were also really fun!
